The file WorldBank.txt contains the total fertility rate and the GDP per capita in US$ (under the variable GDP) 
of 180 countries and regions in 2013 collected by the World Bank. 

The programs world-stats.py and stats.py conduct statistical analysis on a real-life dataset: they read the dataset 
and summarize the dataset using the statistical measures such as the mean, the median, the variance, and the standard deviation of a variable in a data set.
